# Download
### Requirements
NCP is developed based on Kotlin, which means that you need to install KotlinLib on your server to ensure that NCP will work.
**Download KotlinLib here and put it in your ``plugins`` Folder alongside NCP.**
- [KotlinLib](https://cloudburstmc.org/resources/kotlinlib.48/)

### Choose your version
Since No Cheat Plus have been gotten through a long of development there are many versions of the plugin to choose from. We recommend everyone to just use the latest stable Version, because newest Bugfixes and Features will come with this one.

### Download NCP
We recommend you to download the plugin from the NukkitX/CloudBurst page for the latest Release.
However if you want to use a specific release, you can find the build history of the plugin on Jenkins.
* [Jenkins (current)](https://ci.lanink.cn/job/NoCheatPlus/)

* [NukkitX/CloudBurst (stable)](https://cloudburstmc.org/resources/nocheatplus.820/)

* [MCBBS (stable)](https://www.mcbbs.net/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=1430379)

* [MINEBBS (stable)](https://www.minebbs.com/resources/nocheatplus.5551/)

* [PowerNukkitX Hub (current)](https://powernukkitx.com/hub/plugin/detail/Physical-Science-Academy/NoCheatPlus)

### Start the Server
After you've completed all the steps before, start up the server and read the logs. If NCP started successfully a message like ``NoCheatPlus loaded successfully!`` should appear. If make sure that you've installed [KotlinLib](https://cloudburstmc.org/resources/kotlinlib.48/) before.
If you still have problems starting the plugin, you can get help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/bCQ8pEgk4t).
